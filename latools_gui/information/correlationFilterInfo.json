	"filter_description": "The correlation filter can be used to exclude data where two analytes correlate. The filter calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and associated significance statistic (p) across the ablation, and can be used to exclude regions where analytes co-vary significantly using r and p thresholds. For example, where an analyte associated with a secondary contaminant phase co-varies with a target analyte in the host material.",
