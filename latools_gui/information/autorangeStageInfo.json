	"stage_description": "In this stage, you will identify the background, signal and transitional regions in your ablation data. LAtools does this by using your internal standard to discriminate between signal (&#34;laser on&#34;) and background (&#34;laser off&#34;) regions. This will help us in the next stage, when we calculate the background underlying the signal regions.<br> <br> Several parameters can be changed to alter this stages behaviour. In testing, the default values provided were proved to be remarkably robust, so you should not have to change them too much. <br> <br> To run autorange, click <i>APPLY</i>. The graph will now identify the following regions: <ul> <li><b>Grey:</b> signal regions</li> <li><b>Red:</b> background regions</li> <li><b>White:</b> transition regions</li> </ul> <b>Parameters</b> <ul> <li><i>Analyte</i>: the analyte you would like to use to discriminate between signal and background. For best results, choose an analyte that is present homogeneously in high concentrations. The sum of all analytes, <i>total_counts</i>;, can also be used. The default is <i>total_counts</i>.</li> <li><i>Gradient Window</i>: the width (number of data points) of the window used to calculate the first derivative of the smoothed signal. The default is 5. This value must be an integer.</li> <li><i>Smoothing Window</i>: the width (number of data points) of the window used to smooth the raw data. The default is 3. This value must be an integer.</li> <li><i>Transition Window</i>: the number of points either side of identified transitions to include when determining transition width. The default is 20. This value must be an integer. <li><i>Transition Width, Start</i>: the amount of the data to exclude before and after &#34;laser on&#34; transitions. Defined relative to the overall width of the transition. This value must be a real number.</li> <li><i>Transition Width, End</i>: the amount of the data to exclude before and after &#34;laser off&#34; transitions. Defined relative to the overall width of the transition. This value must be a real number.</li> <li><i>Log Transform</i>: if your signals are highly heterogeneous, log transformation can make Autorange work better. Simply tick the Log transform check box to turn this option on.</li> </ul> ",
