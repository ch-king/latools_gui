There are two despiking methods available to use, both of which can be applied. <p><b>Exponential decay despiker</b> <p>Removes low outliers, and replaces them with the average of the adjacent values. If you know the exponetial decay constant of your laser you may specify it; otherwise, leave it blank and LAtools will fit an exponential decay function to your data for you. <p><b>Noise despiker</b> <p>Removes high outliers greater than a specified standard deviation from a rolling mean of your data. <p>To graph your selected despiking method/s, click APPLY.",
