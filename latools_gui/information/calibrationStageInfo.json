This is done by creating a calibration curve for each element, based on SRMs measured throughout your analysis session, and a table of known SRM values. There are several options you can use to change the behaviour of this stage. <br><br> To apply them, click on <i>APPLY</i>.

This value defaults to 10. This value must be an integer.<br> <br> <b>Standard Materials</b><br>A list of SRMs measured throughout the analysis. These are automatically detected by LAtools based on your configuration.<br> <br> <br> Your data is now background corrected, normalised to an internal standard, and calibrated.",
