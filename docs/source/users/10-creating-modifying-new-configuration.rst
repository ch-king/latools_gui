Creating or modifying a configuration
*************************************

Different LA-ICPMS system produce different results in a variety of data formats. You will need to configure LAtools so that it can work with your systems data. If your lab uses only one system, you can set a default configuration specific to that system. If your lab uses more than one system, you will need to create configurations for each one, and specify what configuration you want to use each time you start a new project.
