Creating or modifying a configuration
*************************************

A ‘configuration’ is how LAtools stores the location of a data format description and SRM file to be used during data import and analysis. For labs working with a single LA-MS system, you can set a default configuration, and then leave it alone. If you’re running multiple LA-MS systems, or work with different data formats, you can specify multiple configurations, and specify which one you want to use at the start of analysis.
